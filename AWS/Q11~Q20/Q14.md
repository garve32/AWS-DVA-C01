### 문제
When running a Rolling deployment in Elastic Beanstalk environment, only two batches completed the deployment successfully, while rest of the batches failed to deploy the updated version. Following this, the development team terminated the instances from the failed deployment.

What will be the status of these failed instances post termination?

-   Elastic Beanstalk will replace the failed instances with instances running the application version from the oldest successful deployment
-   Elastic Beanstalk will not replace the failed instances
-   **Elastic Beanstalk will replace the failed instances with instances running the application version from the most recent successful deployment**
-   Elastic Beanstalk will replace the failed instances after the application version to be installed is manually chosen from AWS Console

### 해설
Elastic Beanstalk에서 배치 배포가 실패 했을시 발생하는 동작에 관한 문제.
실패한 배포에서 인스턴스를 종료하면 Elastic Beanstalk는 가장 최근에 성공한 배포에서 애플리케이션 버전을 실행하는 인스턴스로 대체한다.
